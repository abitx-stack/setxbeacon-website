      <p>At BEACON, everything starts with community.
We believe that when people know each other, learn together, and look out for one another, our whole region grows stronger.
Our work focuses on two main areas: helping people take part in civic life and helping neighbors connect through community action. Both are rooted in the same goal: building the kind of Southeast Texas where everyone belongs and has a voice.

          <p>We help our neighbors learn how to take part in the decisions that shape our lives, from registering to vote to understanding when and how to cast a ballot.
Our Civic Engagement Committee focuses on nonpartisan voter registration, election reminders, and sharing clear, accessible information about how local government works.
We also work with local community groups to bring civic education straight to the people, because everyone deserves to feel confident and informed when they participate.

          <p>Our Community Outreach Committee is all about connection. We show up where our neighbors are, supporting local events, volunteering with partner organizations, and helping strengthen the relationships that hold our communities together.
We also host community meetups and socials where people can come together, share ideas, and build friendships that last beyond any single project.
Every action, big or small, helps rebuild the village — the network of trust, care, and connection that keeps Southeast Texas strong.
