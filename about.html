      <p>SETX BEACON grew out of the same energy that started the Southeast Texas Impact Initiative (SETXII). Back then, we were part of the Civic Action Team, neighbors helping neighbors learn about voting, local issues, and how to make a difference right where they live.
As we got to know more people and more communities, we saw something powerful: folks want to be involved. They want to show up. But often, what‚Äôs missing are the connections, the networks of trust and community that make it easier to take action together.
That‚Äôs where BEACON comes in. We started this organization to rebuild that sense of village, to bring people together, share knowledge, and create spaces where everyone feels welcome to take part.Our village is rooted in care, respect, and inclusion. We welcome anyone who shares those values and believes in showing up for one another.
BEACON is a sister organization to SETXII, built to connect neighbors, bridge resources, and work side by side with local groups who are already doing great work across Southeast Texas.
Our focus is simple: helping people learn, connect, and take part through voter registration, civic education, partnerships, and community volunteering. We believe that when people feel informed, connected, and supported, our whole region shines brighter.</p>
